Homework #1 (MCEN5041 { Advanced Fluid Mechanics I)

Problem 1
Using intuition, academic references, the internet, or any other resource to nd appropriate 
uid
(i.e., density, , and viscosity, ) and 
ow (i.e., characteristic length and velocity L and U) prop-
erties, calculate approximate Reynolds numbers Re = UL= for the following systems:
(a) Blood 
ow through a capillary.
(b) Blood 
ow through the aorta.
(c) Water 
owing from a kitchen faucet.
(d) Water 
owing around a small pebble in a gentle creek.
(e) Water 
owing around a large boulder in a gentle creek.
(f) Air 
owing over the wing of an airplane.
(e) A hurricane.
Comment on whether each of the above systems are examples of laminar or turbulent 
ows, and
be sure to clearly cite any references used to nd your answers.
Problem 2
Consider a tornado of radius R which may be simulated as a two-part circulating 
ow in cylindrical
coordinates with vr = vz = 0, v = !r if r  R, and v = !R2=r if r  R. Using appropriate
cylindrical coordinate relations, calculate and plot (a) the vorticity and (b) the strain rates in each
part of the 
ow.
Problem 3
A plane unsteady viscous 
ow is given in polar coordinates by
vr = 0 ; v =

where C is a constant and  is the kinematic viscosity. Compute the vorticity !z(r; t) and plot
a series of representative velocity and vorticity proles at dierent times. By comparing the re-
sults with those for the steady viscous 
ow v = C=r, comment on the eect of the viscosity in the
unsteady 
ow. Does this make sense given what you know about viscosity? Explain why or why not.
